Just clone this repo then `cd` into this directory then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements then run the `main.py` file to start the application.<br>

I'd like some help in making the functions more faster (it hangs on some large numbers) and in making the graph more obvious -- Probably even a `log` graph option.
